13-Oct-2019 -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Copied the Sourceforge site to GitHub.
   Switched from Mercurial to Git.
   Created a README.md file.
   Refactored the Makefile's.
   No changes to the Ada Lapack codes.

06-Aug-2013 -------------------------------------------------------------------

   New procedures in this release are

      syev, syevd, sysv, heev and heevd
         (implementing dsyev, dsyevd, dsysv, zheev, zheevd and zsysv).

   The driver codes have also been extended and now include

      MatrixDeterm, MatrixInverse,
      Eigenvalues, EigenvaluesRealSymm, EigenvaluesHermSymm,
      Eigensystem, EigensystemRealSymm, EigensystemHermSymm,
      SolveSystem, SolveSystemRealSymm, SolveSystemHermSymm

   These provide a more familiar Ada style interface to the Lapack routines.
   There are, as yet, no similar drivers for the singular value decomposition
   procedures (gesv,gesdd).

03-Jan-2013 -------------------------------------------------------------------

   The most significant change since the initial release is the change in the
   package spec to use the standard real and complex arrays provided by Ada.Numerics.
   The package now conforms with Ada Annex G.3.

   New procedures in this release are

      gesdd and gesvd (implementing dgesdd, dgesvd, zgesdd and zgesvd).

   Minor housekeeping has also be done to the code base.

14-Aug-2012 -------------------------------------------------------------------

   This is the first release.

   This includes the Lapack codes (in ada_lapack)

      geev, gesv, getrf, getri, getrs

   which provide native Ada implementations of the standard Lapack codes

      dgeev, dgesv, dgetrf, dgetri, dgetrs,
      zgeev, zgesv, zgetrf, zgetri, zgetrs

   These codes were derived from the Lapack-3.4.1 base.

   There are also some driver codes

      MatrixDeterm, MatrixInverse
      Eigenvalues, Eigensystem
      SolveSystem
